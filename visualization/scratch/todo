* Build a histogram that shows the recency of the pages, i.e., the histogram should how many pages have been modified on a particular date. You can use the last date of change for the pages.
* Group articles based on their recency and display a tag cloud for each group. You can decide on the granularity of the group based on the recency histogram.
- Compute page rank for each wikipedia page and display the top 100 with the highest page rank
* Build a histogram that shows the distribution of pages across categories, i.e., the number of pages in each category
